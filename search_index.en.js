Start a New Node.js Project\nCreate a new directory for your project:\n\nNavigate to the newly created directory and initialize the Node.js project:\n\nThis command generates a package.json file. In this file, add the following entry to enable ES6 modules instead of CommonJS:\n\n2. Install Dependencies\nInstall the necessary dependencies:\n\n@grpc/grpc-js: The gRPC client\n@grpc/proto-loader: A utility for loading .proto files for gRPC services\n\n\nHere are the exact versions used in this post:\n\n3. Create Required Files\nCreate the required files for the project:\n\nDefining the Schema\nLet’s start by defining the schema for communication between the server and the client.\nIn the todo.proto file, create a package called todoPackage and define a service named Todo. This service will expose methods for communication:\n\ncreateTodo: Creates a new to-do item. It accepts a TodoItem (which we'll define later) and returns the created TodoItem.\nreadTodos: Retrieves all to-dos from the server. It takes no parameters and returns a list of TodoItems.\nreadTodosStream: Streams to-dos from the server one by one. This method is more efficient for handling large datasets compared to readTodos, which returns all to-dos in one go.\n\n\nWe also need to define the types used in the method parameters and return types:\n\nNoParams: A method with no parameters.\nTodoItem: Defines the structure of a single to-do item.\nTodoItems: Contains a property items, which is a list of TodoItem objects. Lists/arrays are represented using the repeated keyword.\n\n\nBuilding the Server\nNow, let’s build the server.\nFirst, import the necessary dependencies:\n\nNext, load the schema we defined in todo.proto:\n\nCreate an instance of the gRPC server and add the Todo service:\n\nNext, implement the methods for the Todo service:\n\nThe todos array acts as in-memory storage for the to-dos.\nKey Notes:\n\n\ncreateTodo method:\n\nWe access the incoming to-do item via call.request, which is similar to accessing request.body in REST APIs.\nAfter saving the to-do in the array, we call the callback with the created item.\n\n\n\nreadTodos method:\n\nThis method returns all to-dos at once by invoking the callback with the full list.\n\n\n\nreadTodosStream method:\n\nWe stream each to-do item individually to the client.\n\n\n\nFinally, bind the server to a port and start listening:\n\nBuilding the Client\nThe client setup is similar to the server, so we will skip the repeated steps.\n\nNext, create a new instance of the Todo service and specify the server's address and port:\n\nTo run the client, execute the following command, passing the to-do text as an argument:\n\nInside client.js, access the command-line argument:\n\nThen, invoke the gRPC methods:\n\nExplanation of Calls:\n\nThe first call creates a new to-do on the server.\nThe second call retrieves all to-dos from the server.\nThe third call streams to-dos from the server, with event listeners handling incoming data and the end of the stream.\n\nRunning the Project\n\nIn one terminal, start the server:\n\n\n\nIn another terminal, run the client multiple times with different to-do texts:\n\n\nThat’s it!
